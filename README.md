# e-commerce-back-end

## User Story

As a manger at an internet retail company
I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Usage

1.  Given a functional Express.js API
2.  Once the user adds database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file , then user is able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
3.  Once user enters schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data
4.  Once user enters the command to invoke the application , then their server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
5.  Once the user opens an API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
6.  Once user tests an API POST, PUT and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core ,then I am able tp successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
